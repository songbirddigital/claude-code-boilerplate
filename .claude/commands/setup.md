Read @.claude/agents/INITIALIZER.md and help me set up this project with domain memory.

Context: User wants to initialize a new project or set up domain memory for the first time.

The INITIALIZER will:
1. Ask about project purpose, features, tech stack, constraints
2. Create features.json with initial feature breakdown
3. Initialize progress.log, decisions.md, issues.md
4. Set up docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

Guide the user through this process interactively.
