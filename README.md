# Claude Code Boilerplate

By [Songbird Digital](https://github.com/songbirddigital)

A production-ready boilerplate for Claude Code projects featuring domain memory, guardian agents, self-annealing, and context engineering best practices.

Built on principles from Anthropic's research on [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), [Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), and [Effective Harnesses](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents).

## Design Principles

This boilerplate implements Anthropic's key insights for production AI agents:

### 1. Context Engineering Over Prompt Engineering

> "As models become more capable, the challenge isn't just crafting the perfect prompt—it's thoughtfully curating what information enters the model's limited attention budget at each step."
> — [Anthropic: Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)

**Implementation:**
- **Domain Memory** (`.claude/memory/`) provides persistent state across sessions
- **Session Protocol** loads only relevant context from features.json and progress.log
- **Structured Decision Records** (ADRs) maintain architectural context
- **Agent Protocols** clearly define when and how to invoke specialized agents

### 2. Workflows First, Agents When Needed

> "Start with simple prompts and deterministic workflows, and only add agentic behavior where it's truly valuable."
> — [Anthropic: Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

**Implementation:**
- **IMPLEMENTER** follows a structured workflow: Orient → Plan → Implement → Verify → Update Memory
- **PLANNER** provides guided feature planning with clear deliverables
- **REVIEWER** orchestrates parallel guardians in a deterministic flow
- **Guardians** provide fast, parallel reviews without unnecessary autonomy

### 3. Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Work

> "The magic is in the memory. The magic is in the harness. The magic is not in the personality layer."
> — [Anthropic: Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)

**Implementation:**
- **features.json** tracks project state across sessions (the "harness")
- **progress.log** provides append-only history for context continuity
- **Lifecycle phases** (inception → planning → implementation → testing → review → merged)
- **Handoff context** ensures seamless session transitions

### 4. Self-Improvement with Human Oversight

**Implementation:**
- **Instance-specific feedback** tracked in `.ai/feedback/`
- **Weekly annealing** reviews patterns and proposes improvements
- **Human approval gates** for all changes (never auto-apply)
- **Rollback capability** for any applied improvements

---

## Features

### 🧠 Domain Memory System
- **features.json** — Machine-readable backlog with lifecycle tracking
- **progress.log** — Append-only session history with handoff context
- **decisions.md** — Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- **issues.md** — Problem tracking with resolutions
- **Session continuity** across context windows and time

### 🛡️ 9 Guardian Agents
Specialized reviewers that run in parallel during code review:
- **Security** — OWASP top 10, secrets exposure, injection attacks, tenant isolation
- **TypeScript** — Type safety, strict mode compliance, elimination of `any`
- **Architecture** — Design patterns, modularity, SOLID principles, dependency management
- **API** — REST conventions, versioning, error handling, consistent design
- **Database** — Schema optimization, migration safety, query performance
- **Test** — Coverage analysis, test quality, edge case handling
- **Performance** — N+1 queries, bundle size, algorithmic complexity, memory leaks
- **Accessibility** — WCAG compliance, ARIA usage, keyboard navigation
- **Documentation** — Currency, organization, completeness

### 🎯 Agent Protocols
- **INITIALIZER** — Bootstrap new projects with interactive feature planning
- **PLANNER** — Deep feature planning with architectural considerations
- **IMPLEMENTER** — Structured implementation workflow (default)
- **REVIEWER** — Pre-merge review orchestration with guardian synthesis

### 🔄 Self-Annealing System
Continuous improvement based on actual usage:
- **Feedback tracking** by category (guardians, skills, process, directives, memory)
- **Weekly review cycle** analyzes patterns and proposes improvements
- **Human approval** required for all changes
- **Per-instance learning** with cross-project pattern detection
- **Rollback capability** for any applied changes

### 🎓 Apprentice Mode
Educational assistance that explains the "why" not just the "what":
- Analogies and real-world examples
- Industry context and historical perspective
- Jargon definitions
- Trade-off analysis

### 🔍 Research-First Approach
**CRITICAL:** Always search before recommending:
- "best [month year] [topic]" pattern for current best practices
- GitHub pattern searches for battle-tested solutions
- Technology comparison with current data
- Breaking change detection
- Source citations with dates

### ⚡ External Review Integration
Optional async review from alternative perspectives:
- **Codex** integration (~15 min review cycle)
- **Gemini** secondary reviewer support
- Task-based review workflow in `.ai/tasks/review/`

### 🎨 Feature Completion Workflow
Structured process from inception to merge:
1. Inception → 2. Planning → 3. Implementation → 4. Testing → 5. Review → 6. Merged
- Lifecycle tracking in features.json
- Guardian gates before merge
- Memory updates at each phase

## Key Things to Watch & Improve

### 🔴 High Priority

**1. Memory File Growth**
- Monitor `.claude/memory/features.json` size
- Archive completed features after 50+ entries
- Rotate progress.log quarterly for large projects

**2. Guardian Accuracy**
- Track false positives in `.ai/feedback/guardians/`
- Review guardian findings during weekly annealing
- Adjust guardian prompts based on feedback

**3. Session Startup Time**
- If session start slows, features.json may be too large
- Consider feature archiving or pagination
- Monitor progress.log tail reads

**4. Context Window Utilization**
- Watch for repeated context loading
- Optimize what goes in memory files
- Use memory feedback to track orientation effectiveness

### 🟡 Medium Priority

**5. External Review Quality**
- Compare Codex/Gemini findings to guardian findings
- Track unique issues found by external reviewers
- Adjust review task templates based on results

**6. Search Pattern Effectiveness**
- Log when searches reveal outdated recommendations
- Track technology suggestions by recency
- Update `.ai/context/current-world-state.md` weekly

**7. Agent Invocation Patterns**
- Track when PLANNER vs IMPLEMENTER is invoked
- Monitor if REVIEWER synthesis is effective
- Adjust agent trigger conditions based on usage

### 🟢 Low Priority

**8. Skill Trigger Accuracy**
- Monitor skill invocation patterns in `.ai/feedback/skills/`
- Adjust skill descriptions for clarity
- Add new skills when patterns emerge

**9. Documentation Drift**
- Keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines
- Verify README examples still work
- Update version numbers in docs

**10. Boilerplate Sync**
- Check for upstream improvements monthly
- Test `boilerplate-sync` on fresh instances
- Document migration path for breaking changes

### Key Takeaways Applied

**From "Building Effective Agents" (Dec 2024):**
> "Augment LLMs with retrieval, tools, and memory. Start with simple prompts and deterministic workflows, and only add agentic behavior where it's truly valuable."

**From "Context Engineering" (Sep 2025):**
> "Modern agent quality depends on curating the entire context stack, not just clever prompt text. If you're still treating 'the prompt' as a single text block, you're missing 70% of what makes agents reliable."

**From "Effective Harnesses" (Nov 2025):**
> "The magic is in the memory. The magic is in the harness. The magic is not in the personality layer."
